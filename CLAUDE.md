# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A PowerShell wrapper around upstream [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp), pinned as a submodule at `vendor/llama.cpp/`. No original C/C++ lives here — only `.ps1` scripts driving CMake + MSVC + Conda. The session shell is bash on Windows; the project's own scripts must run from `pwsh`/`powershell`.

## Commands

```powershell
./rebuild_llama.cpp.ps1                          # auto-detects CUDA vs OpenBLAS
./rebuild_llama.cpp.ps1 -version "b1138"         # pin a tag / commit
./rebuild_llama.cpp.ps1 -pullRequest "18675"     # build a PR
./rebuild_llama.cpp.ps1 -target "llama-server"   # CMake target subset
./rebuild_llama.cpp.ps1 -blasAccelerator OFF     # OpenBLAS | CUDA | OFF

./examples/server.ps1 -model ".\vendor\llama.cpp\models\<x>.gguf"
Get-Help -Detailed ./examples/server.ps1         # full option list
```

Binaries land in `./vendor/llama.cpp/build/bin/Release/`. Conda env `llama.cpp` (Python 3.12) must already exist — the scripts call `conda activate llama.cpp` themselves.

**No tests, no linter.** Verify changes by running an example script against a real GGUF model.

## Non-obvious behavior

- **The submodule always shows dirty.** `rebuild_llama.cpp.ps1` prepends an OpenBLAS linking shim to `vendor/llama.cpp/CMakeLists.txt` (idempotent; workaround for `find_package(BLAS)` failing on Windows). `.gitmodules` sets `ignore = dirty` for this reason — don't "clean it up."
- **Each build wipes the submodule** back to `origin/master` then checks out the requested `-version` / PR. Any local edits under `vendor/llama.cpp/` are lost by design.
- **`ml64.exe` (MASM) must be passed as `-DCMAKE_ASM_COMPILER`.** Upstream `ggml/CMakeLists.txt` sets `cmake_policy(SET CMP0194 NEW)` and declares `project(... ASM)`; on CMake 4.1+ with the VS generator this rejects `cl.exe` as the ASM compiler. The script locates `ml64.exe` via `vswhere.exe`. Don't remove.
- **CUDA is selected iff *both* `nvidia-smi` and `nvcc` are on PATH.** Missing either silently falls back to OpenBLAS.
- **`requirements_override.txt` layers on top of upstream `vendor/llama.cpp/requirements.txt`.** It pins `torch` to a CUDA 12.6 wheel, adds `tiktoken` (missing upstream, required for GLM), pins `transformers==5.3.0`, and narrows `numpy` to resolve an `opencv-python-headless` conflict. When bumping any of these, verify both constraints still hold.
- **`server.ps1` reads GGUF metadata** by shelling out to `vendor/llama.cpp/gguf-py/gguf/scripts/gguf_dump.py`. Upstream has moved this path before (CHANGELOG 1.24.0) — if server startup fails with "Failed to extract model details", check the path first.
- **`server.ps1 -additionalArguments` splits on whitespace** and re-pairs tokens into key/value flags. Values that contain spaces will not survive this parser.
