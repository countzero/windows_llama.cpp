# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A PowerShell wrapper around upstream [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp), pinned as a submodule at `vendor/llama.cpp/`. No original C/C++ lives here — only `.ps1` scripts driving CMake + MSVC + Conda. The session shell is bash on Windows; the project's own scripts must run from `pwsh`/`powershell`.

## Commands

```powershell
./rebuild_llama.cpp.ps1                          # auto-detects CUDA vs OpenBLAS
./rebuild_llama.cpp.ps1 -version "b1138"         # pin a tag / commit
./rebuild_llama.cpp.ps1 -pullRequest "18675"     # build a PR
./rebuild_llama.cpp.ps1 -target "llama-server"   # CMake target subset
./rebuild_llama.cpp.ps1 -blasAccelerator OFF     # OpenBLAS | CUDA | OFF

./examples/server.ps1 -model ".\vendor\llama.cpp\models\<x>.gguf"
Get-Help -Detailed ./examples/server.ps1         # full option list
```

Binaries land in `./vendor/llama.cpp/build/bin/Release/`. Conda env `llama.cpp` (Python 3.12) must already exist — the scripts call `conda activate llama.cpp` themselves.

**No tests, no linter.** Verify changes by running an example script against a real GGUF model.

## Non-obvious behavior

- **The submodule always shows dirty.** `rebuild_llama.cpp.ps1` prepends an OpenBLAS linking shim to `vendor/llama.cpp/CMakeLists.txt` (idempotent; workaround for `find_package(BLAS)` failing on Windows). `.gitmodules` sets `ignore = dirty` for this reason — don't "clean it up."
- **Each build wipes the submodule** back to `origin/master` then checks out the requested `-version` / PR. Any local edits under `vendor/llama.cpp/` are lost by design.
- **`ml64.exe` (MASM) must be passed as `-DCMAKE_ASM_COMPILER`.** Upstream `ggml/CMakeLists.txt` sets `cmake_policy(SET CMP0194 NEW)` and declares `project(... ASM)`; on CMake 4.1+ with the VS generator this rejects `cl.exe` as the ASM compiler. The script locates `ml64.exe` via `vswhere.exe`. Don't remove.
- **CUDA is selected iff *both* `nvidia-smi` and `nvcc` are on PATH.** Missing either silently falls back to OpenBLAS.
- **Build parallelism caps at physical cores, not logical processors.** `cmake --build --parallel` is fed `Sum(Win32_Processor.NumberOfCores)` (drops SMT siblings). Upstream sets `UseMultiToolTask=true` + `EnforceProcessCountAcrossBuilds=true` (`vendor/llama.cpp/CMakeLists.txt:92-93`), so this single value caps total `cl.exe`/`nvcc` parallelism — no per-project `/MP` multiplication. Logical-processor count starves the OS scheduler and doubles peak `nvcc` RAM with negligible throughput gain on FP/memory-bound compilation. Override with `-parallelJobs N`. Don't change the default back.
- **`requirements_override.txt` layers on top of upstream `vendor/llama.cpp/requirements.txt`.** It pins `torch` to a CUDA 12.6 wheel, adds `tiktoken` (missing upstream, required for GLM), pins `transformers==5.3.0`, and narrows `numpy` to resolve an `opencv-python-headless` conflict. When bumping any of these, verify both constraints still hold.
- **`server.ps1` reads GGUF metadata** by shelling out to `vendor/llama.cpp/gguf-py/gguf/scripts/gguf_dump.py`. Upstream has moved this path before (CHANGELOG 1.24.0) — if server startup fails with "Failed to extract model details", check the path first.
- **`server.ps1 -additionalArguments` splits on whitespace** and re-pairs tokens into key/value flags. Values that contain spaces will not survive this parser.

## Presets

VRAM-tier presets: `presets/models_16GB_VRAM.ini`, `presets/models_24GB_VRAM.ini`.
See `presets/README.md` for the user-facing quick-start; notes below are for editing.

- **`mmproj-offload = true` fails silently at startup on a saturated GPU.** CLIP's warmup
  compute buffer OOMs but the server keeps running — only image requests error at generation
  time. Set `false` on tiers where LLM + KV already saturate VRAM.

**ngram-mod speculative decoding** (`--spec-type ngram-mod`): model-agnostic, works on any model.
- All models: `spec-ngram-mod-n-match = 24`, `spec-ngram-mod-n-min = 48`, `spec-ngram-mod-n-max = 64`
  (matches the struct defaults in `common/common.h:329-337` and what `--spec-default` produces
  at `common/arg.cpp:4065-4074`; ggerganov confirmed post-merge in PR #19164 that the min/max
  "likely don't need to be changed from the recommended values"; MoEs require long drafts and
  dense models tolerate them without noticeable cost). Flags were renamed from
  `--draft-min`/`--draft-max`/`--spec-ngram-size-n` in upstream PR #22397; the old names now
  error at startup.
- `n_match < 16` logs a "too small — poor quality is possible" warning at
  `vendor/llama.cpp/common/speculative.cpp:1031-1034`; parser accepts `1..1024`
  (`common/arg.cpp:3606-3615`), so 16 is the lowest non-warning value, not a hard floor.
  Min/max parsers accept `0..1024` (`common/arg.cpp:3587-3605`).
- Memory overhead: ~16 MiB **total**, shared across all server slots
  (single `common_ngram_mod` instance allocated at `common/speculative.cpp:1026`).
- Pool auto-resets on `begin()` if occupancy > 25 %, and after 3 consecutive rounds with
  acceptance < 50 % (`common/speculative.cpp:720-728`, `:790-806`). Smaller `n_match` makes
  these resets fire more often and wipes ngrams learned from the current prompt — another
  reason to stay at `n_match ≥ 24`.
